# Network and security

socket: transport to transport layers commuciations

applications layer: request and response

what transport service does an app need?
transport layer provides
1. data integrity 
2. timing: some apps (e.g internet telephony, interactive games)required low delay to be effective.
3. throughput: some apps required minimum amount of throughput to be "effective"
4. security: encryption, data integrity ( three hand shake)

# Internt transport protocols Services

TCP and UDP  service: 
TCP: reliable transport between sending and reciving process UDP: unrealible 
flow control: sender won't overwhelm reciver 
congestion control: ghalib road wala example
does not provide: timing, minimum throughput guarantee, security
connection-oriented: setup required between client and server processess. 

#Securing TCP:
TCP&UDP
no encryption
cleartext passwds sent into socket traverse internet in cleartext.
##SSL
provides encrypted TCP conncection
data integrity 
end-point authentication

SSL is at app layer
apps use SSL Libraries 


Web and HTTP
http is "stateless" server maintains no ser

 
http responses messegae is very important for devops 
request id important for developer but we need to understand that
